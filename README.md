# DRL-Enhanced-Interactive-Segmentation-PyTorch-Implementation-
This project enhances interactive segmentation by incorporating Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to refine user-provided click positions before using NuClick for segmentation. The primary goal is to adjust user clicks towards the center of objects, improving segmentation accuracy.
